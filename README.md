### Lessons Learned
I learned how to make a full stack project by myself which was extremely rewarding. I used Test Driven Development to map out each entity and its fields. Up until this project I had written a few tests but I relied on my test this time around. I did some work then tested did some more work then tested. the importance of TDD is extremely vital when connecting a full stack project because you can take large leaps in connecting and if you don't test the trouble shooting process will be long and you will be lost and guessing on what you may think may be the problem. Guessing is not a game programmers should play.
